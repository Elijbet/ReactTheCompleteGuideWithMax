Course Notes:

* React folder structure
* JSX is actually JS and not html. JSX is syntactic sugar. If we didn't use JSX, we'd have to use React.createElement for each tag. Gets out of hand easily.
* JSX vs HTML. React uses JSX – a declarative JavaScript XML which allows developers to write components leveraging the power of JavaScript, while Vue.js uses HTML templates to create views [1].
* There’s a Babel plugin to use JSX with Vue, getting us back to a syntax that’s closer to templates.
